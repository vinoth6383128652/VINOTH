# Include the dataset source and a brief description for chatbot in python

# Dataset Source:

In this example, I'll use a small custom dataset to create a rule-based chatbot that can respond to common user intents, such as greetings, inquiries about the weather, and requests for jokes.

# Description of the Chatbot:

We'll create a simple rule-based chatbot in Python using a predefined dataset that maps user intents to chatbot responses. The chatbot will recognize user inputs and respond based on the intent detected. Here's the Python code:

# Define a dataset for common conversation intents

dataset = {
"greetings": {
"examples": ["hello", "hi", "hey", "howdy"],
"responses": ["Hello! How can I help you?", "Hi there!", "Hey!"]
},
"weather": {
"examples": ["What's the weather like today?", "Tell me the weather forecast."],
"responses": ["I'm sorry, I don't have access to weather information."]
},
"jokes": {
"examples": ["Tell me a joke", "Can you make me laugh?"],
"responses": ["Sure, here's a joke: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!"]
},
"goodbye": {
"examples": ["goodbye", "bye", "see you later"],
"responses": ["Goodbye! Have a great day.", "See you later!"]
}
}

# Function to get the chatbot's response
def chatbot_response(user_input):
user_input = user_input.lower()
for intent, data in dataset.items():
for example in data["examples"]:
if example in user_input:
return data["responses"][0] # Respond with the first response for the matched intent
return "I'm sorry, I don't understand that."

# User interaction loop
while True:
user_input = input("You: ")
if user_input.lower() == "exit":
print("Chatbot: Goodbye!")
break
response = chatbot_response(user_input)
print("Chatbot:", response)
